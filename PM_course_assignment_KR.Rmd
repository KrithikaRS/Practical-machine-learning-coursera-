# since the outcome varibale is a class variable or ordinal variable, this is attempted as a classification prediction problem
##Hence methods like classification tree, random forest, KNN are considered as suitable prediction methods.
# First attempted with rpart classification is used to build model using training set
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv",number = 5)

pred1<-predict(modFit, new_validation)
summary(pred1)
confusionMatrix(pred1, new_validation$classe)
### The accuracy of this method is not great, 0.3. with significant p-value
# Secondly the same data is classified using K-nearest neighbor method is used to build another model for comparison and the classes are compared
modFit2 <- train(classe~., data=new_train2, method="knn", trControl=fitControl)
pred2 <- predict(modFit2, new_validation)

table(pred2, new_validation$classe)
##Here the accuracy of the prediction was greater than 30%. So it was used for prediction in the test data
qplot(pred1, pred2, color = classe, data = new_validation)
##Note:application of random forest method would have been a appropriate method as well. But it was computationally expensive and causes the system to break.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
